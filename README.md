# Laravel Mix make file hash

By default, the hashing system in Laravel Mix will append a querystring to the filename to invalidate the cache.

Example from `mix-manifest.json`:

```json
{
    "/dist/main.js": "/dist/main.js?id=1e70e7c11a9185f57e64"
}
```

The problem is that this way of hashing may not work with some caching systems.

Instead, **"Laravel Mix make file hash" will move the hash into the filename of the hashed files**. So your `mix-manifest.json` will look something like this:

```json
{
    "/dist/main.js": "/dist/main.1e70e7c11a9185f57e64.js"
}
```

## Under the hood

To accomplish the re-hashing, this script will:

1. Read the `mix-manifest.json` generated by Laravel Mix.
2. Remove stale hashed files.
3. Rename the files found in the manifest to include the hash within the filename.
4. Update `mix-manifest.json` with the new filenames.
5. Return the contents of the new manifest for further usage (if required).

Turn on debug to activate noisy feedback:
 `{ debug: true }`

## Installation

Install package from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/laravel-mix-make-file-hash):

```bash
npm i -D laravel-mix-make-file-hash
# or
yarn add laravel-mix-make-file-hash -D
```

## Normal usage

```js
if (mix.inProduction()) {
    mix.version()
    mix.then(() => {
        const convertToFileHash = require("laravel-mix-make-file-hash")
        convertToFileHash({
            publicPath: 'web',
            manifestFilePath: 'web/mix-manifest.json',
        })
    })
}
```

## Promise usage

`convertToFileHash` returns a Promise containing the new `mix-manifest.json` contents. This means you can perform another task after the `convertToFileHash` has finished the re-hashing.

```js
if (mix.inProduction()) {
    mix.version()
    mix.then(async () => {
        const convertToFileHash = require("laravel-mix-make-file-hash")
        const fileHashedManifest = await convertToFileHash({
            publicPath: 'web',
            manifestFilePath: 'web/mix-manifest.json',
        })
        // Do something here...
    })
}
```

## Options

```js
laravelMixMakeFileHash({
    publicPath: 'web',
    manifestFilePath: 'web/mix-manifest.json',
    delSyncOptions: { force: true },
    debug: false,
})
```
